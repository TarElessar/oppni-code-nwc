%   x is a matrix (or vector, or single value) of values at which the 
%       Psi or DiGamma function  psi(x) is to be calculated.
%   epsilon is some kind of absolute  error.  
%   
%   If x<N then x is first increased up to x+N using the  recursion relation 
%      Psi(z) = Psi(1+z) - 1/z, 
%   and then the much LARger value of Psi(x+N) is  calculated  with an 
%   asymptotic formula.  N is determined by epsilon and a guessed order
%   of magnitude of the error in the asymptotic formula.
